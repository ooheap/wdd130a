I really like sports so I chose to focus the content around my favorite football player, Justin Herbert. I communicated with my developer through email and in person during class. There were no issues in communication. Yes, my developer met my expectations, he did a great job. Next time, I will make sure I get all the content to my developer right away.</p>

My team leads were pretty clear with assigning me content to complete. I contributed to both sites as my team leads instructed to. I didn't have any GitHub issues at this point.</p>

                <div>
                    <p class="report-paragraph">I communicated my tasks to my junior developers in person and over email. I communicated with my client mostly in person during class, and a little bit over email. There were not any major issues with communication, however it did take a while for me to receive the content from my client for the webpage which was a minor hold up. I used GitHub pages to publish it and gave my client access to the repository. It took me a while to really understand GitHub, but i managed to make it work and feel good about using GitHub now.</p>

                <div>
                    <p class="report-paragraph">The most challenging part of the project was learning to use GitHub. I have always been a little confused on how to use GitHub but I overcame the problems I had. I enjoyed designing my own webpage with a site plan and wireframe and seeing it come to life. If I were to do this project again I would get in contact with my junior devs much earlier and collaborate with them much more. I feel confident working on real-world projects after this experience because I feel confident in using GitHub and communicating with a team to distribute a workload.</p>
